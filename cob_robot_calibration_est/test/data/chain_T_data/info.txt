For each test sample dh and joints are inputs.

All angles are radians when applicible

dh is a Nx4 matrix, Where the columns correspond the the
dh parameters [theta, alpha, a, d]. Each row of dh
corresponds to a link in the kinematic chain.

joints is a Nx1 matrix, which stores the joint positions
of the links in the chain

output is a 4x4 transformation matrix corresponding to the
pose of the chain's tip, given the specificied joint positions
